## 诱骗耗牛
```

# Senick needs big bait for a big burl!
# Help Senick find an above average yak!
# Don't pick one too deep in the herd, or risk angering the group.

# This function should return the average size of all the yaks:
def averageSize(yaks):
    sum = 0
    # Go through each yak and add its size to the sum.
    for yak in yaks:
        sum=sum+yak.size
    return sum / yaks.length

yaks = hero.findEnemies()
avgSize = averageSize(yaks)

bestYak = None
closestDist = 9999
for i in range(len(yaks)):
    yak = yaks[i]
    yakDistance = hero.distanceTo(yak)
    yakSize = yak.size
    # Check if the yak is:
    # The distance is closer than the current 'closestDist' AND
    # The size is bigger than the 'avgSize'.
    if yakDistance<closestDist and yakSize>avgSize:
        # Update the 'bestYak' and 'closestDist'
        closestDist=yakDistance
        bestYak=yak

# Say the 'bestYak':
hero.say(bestYak)
